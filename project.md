## Goal
The goal of the team project is to research a case different from the four cases we are studying in class. The case should be based on AI technology; and the project should discuss the technology, social impact, and legal aspects of the technology, similar to how the lecturers present the cases.

## Content
The project should include one or more interviews with the technology/social/legal experts who are knowledgeable about the case. The interviews can be conducted orally (phone interviews are okay) or by email.

## Teams
This is a team-based project. Please form teams of **3 students** by **March 7**. If you need help forming teams, advertise yourself and find your teammate in class.

## Project Grading (60% of Course Grade)
- **Proposal presentation**: 10%
- **Progress presentation**: 10%
- **Final presentation**: 15%
- **Final report**: 10%
- **Peer grading**: 10%
- **Teamwork report**: 5%

**Note that any team may get up to -25%p for project scores if there is a serious problem with teamwork.**
That means, the project grade could be 35/60, even if all presentation and report scores are perfect.
This can apply to an individual student, or to the entire team.

## Deliverables
**All project team members should present an important part in the presentation (speak for at least one minute each)**.
You should present your work in the presentation session. 
- **Proposal presentation video**: 5-8 minute presentation video (recorded)
- **Progress presentation video**: 7-10 minute presentation video (recorded)
- **Final presentation**: 10-15 minute presentation
- **Final report**: 4-6 pages report (+ unlimited references) and slides used for final presentation
- **Peer grading**: 4 peer gradings for proposal, progress, final presentation, and final report
- **Teamwork report**: (individually written/submitted) description of what each team member did

## Instruction
**Choose topic(s) and conduct interview(s).**
- **Topics** have to be related to AI and its social impact
- Specific **case** has to be proposed and researched on
- Contact interviewees who are knowledgeable about the case and can have an interview regarding the issue
- The topics should be about a case different from the four cases we are studying in class

**Based on the interview(s), prepare your final presentation and report.**
- They should discuss the technology, social impact, and legal aspects of the technology, including case studies that your team worked on.

## Project Proposal
Give a **5-8 minute proposal presentation video** that includes the following:
- **Problem**: What is the topic of your paper? What is the specific case being tackled? Why is it important to consider this case?
- **Related work**: What kind of social issues have been proposed regarding this problem? What kind of solutions or considerations were proposed?
- **Technology**: What kind of technology was used in this case?
- **Social Impact**: What/How was this technologyâ€™s social impact?
- **Legal Aspects**: What does the current law lack regarding this issue? What kind of legislation is needed for this technology?
- **Interview**: Who do you wish to interview (It is suggested to have multiple candidates since all of the interviewees may not be able to be interviewed)? Why did you pick those people? 
- **Plan**: Explain a week-by-week plan for completing this project, clearly indicating which tasks will be done by which team member, and which tasks will be done together.

## Progress Update
Record a **7-10 minute progress presentation video** that includes the following:
- **Introduction**: Please briefly explain your topic, case, and societal issue.
- **Interview**:
  - Who did your team interview? Why were those people chosen? Which part (technology/social impact/legal aspects) did the interviewee most talk about?
  - What kind of questions were asked?
  - What did you learn from the interview(s)? Do you wish to conduct more interviews?
- **Plan**:
  - Again, how will you improve or modify your research? Please have a more concrete plan for this based on the interviews and research conducted.

## Final Presentation & Final Report
Give a **10-15 minute final presentation** and submit a **4-6 page (+ unlimited references) report**. Below is the structure of the final report. The final presentation should contain the same content but in a presentation style.
