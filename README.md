## Course
This course consists of lectures, readings, discussions, quizzes, and team projects.
Students will be asked to do the following things.  

1.	Group discussion write-up, one per week 
2.  Individual discussion prompt, one per week
3.	Team project proposal presentation, progress presentation, final presentation, final report  
4.	Peer review of team project presentations

### Lecture
The students will be asked to watch one or two videos before each class, and some classes will also include in-class lectures.

### Discussion
Students will discuss with their groups the topics based on the lectures/interviews they watched with thought-provoking questions.
You will analyze deeply how artificial intelligence affects various aspects of our society, including but not limited to policy, ethics, education, and social services.
You will present and discuss ideas for further consideration in AI and its social impact.
* 12 in-class discussions (see schedule).
* Organize a group of 3 people, and have time to present what you think and discuss
* All groups should submit their result at the end of class.
* See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/coe491-ai-and-society-spring-2024/discussion).

### Team Project
The goal of the team project is to research a case different from the four cases we are studying in class. The case should be based on AI technology; and the project should discuss the technology, social impact, and legal aspects of the technology, similar to how the lecturers present the cases. The project should include one or more interviews with the technology/social/legal experts who are knowledgeable about the case. The interviews can be conducted orally (phone interviews are okay) or by email. See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs492-ai-and-society-spring-2024/project).

### Policy on Large Language Models
Recent progress in large-scale language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, motivates explicit policies.
* The entire course policy is **LLM-agnostic**: no grader will ever evaluate your submission differently because they suspect it was generated by an LLM.
* You are free to use an LLM as long as you **acknowledge** it.
* You are ultimately responsible for whatever you submit like with any other online tool.
* You will be asked to state how you are assisted by LLM at the end of the semester to evolve in future courses.

## Evaluation (Subject to Change)
The final grade of this course is provided as S/U, and the cut-off point of S grade will be announced soon.
1.	Attendance and participation 10%
2.	Group discussion write-ups 20%
3.	Peer reviews 10%
4.	Team project 60%
